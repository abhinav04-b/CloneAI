The Flask app is a web-based chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to provide responses to user input. It consists of a server and a web page that allows users to input text and receive responses from the chatbot. The server processes incoming requests and sends user input to the GPT-3 model, while the web page displays the input form and chatbot responses.
